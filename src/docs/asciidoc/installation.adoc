== Installing and Configuring

=== Enabling the Topic Selector Plug-in[[enable_topic_selector]]

The topic selector plugin is included with RabbitMQ. Like any RabbitMQ
plugin, you need to enable the plugin in order to use it.

Enable the plugin using the `rabbitmq-plugins` command:

 rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_jms_topic_exchange


You don't need to restart the broker to activate the plugin.

[NOTE]
====
You need to enable this plugin only if you plan to use topic selectors
in your JMS client applications
====

=== Installing JMS Client library

Use your favorite build management tool to add the client dependencies to your project.

==== Maven

.pom.xml
[source,xml,subs="attributes,specialcharacters"]
----
<dependencies>

  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.rabbitmq.jms</groupId>

  </dependency>

</dependencies>
----

Milestones and release candidates require to declare the <<milestone-rc-repository,appropriate repository>>.
Snapshots require to declare their <<snapshot-repository,own repository>> as well.

==== Gradle

=== Enabling the JMS client in a Java container

To enable the JMS Client in a Java container (e.g. Java EE application
server, web container), you must install the JMS client JAR files and
its dependencies in the container and then define JMS resources in
the container's naming system so that JMS clients can look them up.
The methods for accomplishing these tasks are container-specific, please
refer to the vendors`' documentation.

For standalone applications, you need to add the JMS client JAR files
and its dependencies to the application classpath. The JMS resources
can be defined programmatically or through a dependency injection
framework like Spring.

=== Defining the JMS Connection Factory

To define the JMS `ConnectionFactory` in JNDI, e.g. in Tomcat:

[source,xml]
--------
<Resource name="jms/ConnectionFactory"
            type="javax.jms.ConnectionFactory"
         factory="com.rabbitmq.jms.admin.RMQObjectFactory"
        username="guest"
        password="guest"
     virtualHost="/"
            host="localhost"
            port="5672"/>
--------

To define the JMS `ConnectionFactory` in JNDI, e.g. in WildFly (as of JMS Client 1.7.0):

[source,xml]
--------
<object-factory name="java:global/jms/ConnectionFactory"
                   module="org.jboss.genericjms.provider"
                   class="com.rabbitmq.jms.admin.RMQObjectFactory">
     <environment>
         <property name="className" value="javax.jms.ConnectionFactory"/>
         <property name="username" value="guest"/>
         <property name="password" value="guest"/>
         <property name="virtualHost" value="/"/>
         <property name="host" value="localhost"/>
         <property name="port" value="5672"/>
     </environment>
</object-factory>
--------

Here is the equivalent Spring bean example (Java configuration):
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Bean
public ConnectionFactory jmsConnectionFactory() {
  RMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new RMQConnectionFactory();
  connectionFactory.setUsername("guest");
  connectionFactory.setPassword("guest");
  connectionFactory.setVirtualHost("/");
  connectionFactory.setHost("localhost");
  connectionFactory.setPort(5672);
  return connectionFactory;
}
----

And here is the Spring XML configuration:

[source,xml]
--------
<bean id="jmsConnectionFactory" class="com.rabbitmq.jms.admin.RMQConnectionFactory" >
  <property name="username" value="guest" />
  <property name="password" value="guest" />
  <property name="virtualHost" value="/" />
  <property name="host" value="localhost" />
  <property name="port" value="5672" />
</bean>
--------

The following table lists all of the attributes/properties that are available.

|===
| Attribute/Property | JNDI only? | Description |

| `name`
| Yes
| Name in JNDI.
|

| `type`
| Yes
| Name of the JMS interface the object implements, usually `javax.jms.ConnectionFactory`. Other choices are `javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory` and `javax.jms.TopicConnectionFactory`. You can also use the name of the (common) implementation class, `com.rabbitmq.jms.admin.RMQConnectionFactory`.
|

| `factory`
| Yes
| JMS Client for RabbitMQ `ObjectFactory` class, always `com.rabbitmq.jms.admin.RMQObjectFactory`.
|

| `username`
| No
| Name to use to authenticate a connection with the RabbitMQ broker. The default is "guest".
|

| `password`
| No
| Password to use to authenticate a connection with the RabbitMQ broker. The default is "guest".
|

| `virtualHost`
| No
| RabbitMQ https://www.rabbitmq.com/vhosts.html[virtual host] within which the application will operate. The default is "/".
|

| `host`
| No
| Host on which RabbitMQ is running. The default is "localhost".
|

| `port`
| No
| RabbitMQ port used for connections. The default is "5672" unless this is a link:https://rabbitmq.com/ssl.html[TLS connection], in which case the default is "5671".
|

| `ssl`
| No
| Whether to use an SSL connection to RabbitMQ. The default is "false". See the `useSslProtocol` methods for more information.
|

| `uri`
| No
| The link:https://rabbitmq.com/uri-spec.html[AMQP 0-9-1 URI] string used to establish a RabbitMQ connection. The value can encode the `host`, `port`, `username`, `password` and `virtualHost` in a single string. Both 'amqp' and 'amqps' schemes are accepted. Note: this property sets other properties and the set order is unspecified.
|

| `uris`
| No
| A list of link:https://rabbitmq.com/uri-spec.html[AMQP 0-9-1 URI] strings to establish a connection to one of the nodes of a RabbitMQ cluster. Each URI is processed in the same way as the `uri` property (`host`, `port`, `username`, etc). This has the same effect as specifying a https://rabbitmq.com/api-guide.html#endpoints-list[list of endpoints in the AMQP client]. The property is a `List<String>` in the `RMQConnectionFactory` and a `String` expecting a list of comma-separated URIs in the `RMQObjectFactory` (JNDI). Note: this property sets other properties and the set order is unspecified.
|

| `onMessageTimeoutMs`
| No
| How long to wait for `MessageListener#onMessage()` to return, in milliseconds. Default is 2000 ms.
|

| `preferProducerMessageProperty`
| No
| Whether `MessageProducer` properties (delivery mode, priority, TTL) take precedence over respective `Message` properties or not. Default is true (which is compliant to the JMS specification).
|

| `requeueOnMessageListenerException`
| No
| Whether requeuing messages on a `RuntimeException` in the `MessageListener` or not. Default is false.
|

| `queueBrowserReadMax`
| No
| The maximum number of messages to read on a queue browser. Default is 0 (no limit).
|

| `onMessageTimeoutMs`
| No
| The time in milliseconds `MessageListener#onMessage(Message)` can take to process a message. Default is 2000 ms.
|

| `channelsQos`
| No
| https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-prefetch.html[QoS setting] for channels created by the connection factory. Default is -1 (no QoS).
|

| `terminationTimeout`
| No
| The time in milliseconds a `Connection#close()` should wait for threads/tasks/listeners to complete. Default is 15,000 ms.
|

| `declareReplyToDestination`
| No
| Whether `replyTo` destination for consumed messages should be declared. Default is true.
|

| `keepTextMessageType`
| No
| When set to `true`, the AMQP `JMSType` header will be set automatically to `"TextMessage"` for ``TextMessage``s published to AMQP-backed ``Destination``s. Default is false.
